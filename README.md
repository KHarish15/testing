## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing

This guide details setting up GitHub Actions for your Python project, focusing on running Pytest tests.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a new file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This is a standard location for GitHub Actions workflows.  The following content will run tests on every push.

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or any branch you want to trigger tests on
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9' # Or your desired Python version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
```


**2. Required Environment Variables (None in this case):**

No specific environment variables are required for this project.


**3. Dependencies:**

The project requires `pytest`. This will be installed automatically in step 3 of the workflow file.


**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Pytest):**

Pytest is already configured in the workflow file. Ensure that `test_main.py` is in the same directory as `main.py`.  The workflow will automatically locate and execute `test_main.py`.  The code snippet you provided for test functions is missing the actual `test_divide()` function and the import `from main import ...` will need to be present in your `test_main.py` for the tests to run successfully.


**5. Viewing Test Results:**

After a push or pull request, GitHub Actions will execute the workflow. Navigate to the Actions tab in your repository on GitHub.  Find the workflow run and click on it. The logs will show the output of the test execution, including any failures. A summary table will show the test outcome, successful/failed test counts.


**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Tests fail:** Double-check your `test_main.py` file for syntax errors, missing imports, incorrect assertions, or any issues in the `main.py` functions.  Ensure the `test_divide` function is correctly implemented and that the `main` module contains all the functions needed. Verify if all dependencies were installed successfully. Review the workflow logs for detailed error messages.
* **Python version incompatibility:** If you encounter an error related to Python version, ensure that the correct Python version is specified in the `with` statement of the "Set up Python" step.  Verify the Python version in the `requirements.txt` file.
* **Missing `pytest`:** If `pytest` isn't found, ensure the `pip install pytest` command is working in the workflow step.
* **Issues with `main.py` or `test_main.py`:** Check for simple logic errors or typos in these files.


**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps (None):**

This simple project structure does not require any specific project-level configurations beyond the code itself and the workflow file.

**Important Note:** This example assumes the correct file structure (`main.py` and `test_main.py`) is present. Ensure your directory structure matches this expectation.  Ensure your `test_main.py` file contains appropriate tests for `main.py`, including the `test_divide()` function mentioned in your prompt. Add more tests to your project, and run the tests thoroughly to cover all aspects of your code.  If your project requires additional configuration (e.g., using virtual environments), add them to the workflow file accordingly.

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
