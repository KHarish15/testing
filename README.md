# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing

This guide details setting up GitHub Actions for the Python project `KHarish15/testing`.  The project structure is assumed to be simple, with `main.py` containing functions and `test_*.py` files for tests.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This will define the CI/CD workflow.

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9" # Or your desired Python version
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
```

**2. Required Environment Variables:**

None required for this project.

**3. Dependencies:**

Install `pytest` as specified in the dependencies list.  The `pip install pytest` command in the workflow ensures this is done on each run.

**4. Test Framework Configuration:**

The provided `test_*.py` files likely follow standard `pytest` conventions. No special configuration is needed beyond the `pytest` dependency installation.

**5. Viewing Test Results:**

GitHub Actions will display the test results in the Actions tab of your repository's main page.  The output will indicate if tests passed or failed, and the workflow status will reflect the result (success or failure).  Scroll through the logs of the `Run tests` step to see detailed output about the individual tests.

**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Tests failing:** Check the output of the `Run tests` step.  It will show you exactly which tests failed and the error messages. Common issues include typos in code, incorrect assertions, or unforeseen dependencies.
* **`pip` installation problems:** Ensure `pip` is correctly installed and upgraded within the workflow using `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. Verify that `pip` can find and install packages.
* **Python version mismatch:** If you're using a specific Python version, ensure the `python-version` in the `setup-python` step matches the version used to develop your code and run the tests.

**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps:**

* **Test file organization:** Ensure your test files are organized in a way that `pytest` can discover them.  Common locations are a `test` directory or a folder with files matching `test_*.py`.
* **Error handling:** Review the `main.py` functions and ensure the `ValueError` exceptions are properly handled both inside and outside the function.

**Example project structure (recommended):**

```
KHarish15/testing/
├── main.py
└── test/
    └── test_main.py
```


**Example `main.py`:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# ... other functions ...
```

**Example `test_main.py`:**
```python
import pytest
from main import add, subtract, divide, multiply, is_even, get_max

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
```

**Important:**  This configuration assumes a relatively simple project structure.  If your project has a more complex setup (e.g., virtual environments), adjust the workflow accordingly.  Always thoroughly examine the test output to understand the root cause of any failures. Remember to commit and push the `.github/workflows/test.yml` file to your repository for the workflow to be triggered.

## Generated Files

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

## How to Use

1. Push code to trigger automated tests
2. View results in the Actions tab
3. Tests run on every push and pull request

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
